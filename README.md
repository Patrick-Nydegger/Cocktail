# Cocktail
ML and Knowledge Engineering Student Project

The "Cocktail" project is focused on building an AI system that uses computer vision and a graphical database to suggest and provide cocktail recipes based on the ingredients available in a home bar. The project is implemented in Python.

## Computer vision
The system follows a structured process: it starts with YOLOv8 for bottle recognition (pre-trained on the COCO class-id 39) and then moves to bottle tracking. Next, objects are forwarded to the OCR function to read the bottle labels, with each bottle's OCR text output as a list. The final step, comparing OCR text lists with a database of possible texts for predefined bottle categories (Whiskey, Rum, Campari, etc.), is not yet implemented due to the OCR's limited performance. This step could still serve as a foundation for future comparative work.

After 12 iterations, the object recognition is usable, although not optimal. The Python code generated by ChatGPT functions but is complex, prompting a shift in approach. For this reason, a second approach was started with a self-trained CV model. (6 classes, 2514 labeled images, resulting in 6034 labeled images after processing with rotation, exposure, and distortion adjustments). This approach achieves high instance recognition but presents challenges: bottle design changes require retraining, scaling to many classes is time-intensive, only original bottles are recognized, and self-filled beverages remain undetected.

Therefore, the two approaches are currently being combined. First, the bottles are recognized, and these image sections are evaluated using the self-trained model (based on the most common bottles). If a label is found, the bottle is added to 'detected bottles'. If the label is not recognized, the OCR module is called up and, similar to the first attempt, compared with a list. If this also proves unsuccessful, the bottle will need to be labeled manually. This process is still under development and subject to further refinement.

## Knowledge engineering
In addition to this CV module, a database is also implemented, which stores recipes and essentials for the cocktails. 

## Further ideas
If there is enough time, the system suggests recipes that the user might like. this is done based on the recipes used (ingredients, categories) and the star rating with KNN or a decision tree / gradient boosting.
